# Serverless Workshop Infrastructure

## Overview

This repository contains infrastructure and application code for a Serverless Workshop, which aims to provide a hands-on experience with serverless architecture using AWS services. The project utilizes AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) to define cloud infrastructure as code.

## Prerequisites

> If you are working on a Windows machine, we recommend using [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

Ensure the following tools are installed:

- [Python 3.9 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

## Lab #1

1. Start by cloning this repository:
    
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:56kcloud/serverless-workshop.git
    cd serverless-workshop
    ```

2. Create a new branch with your UNIQUE team name:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <your-unique-team-name>
    ```

3. Define an environment variable with your team name:

    ```bash
    export TEAM=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
    ```

4. Create a virtual Python environment and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    python3.9 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ```

5. Run application unit tests:

    ```bash
    python -m unittest tests/test_handler.py 
    ```

    Fix the failing tests if any.

6. Commit

    ```bash
    git commit -a -m "Fixed unit tests"

7. Push

    ```bash
    git push -u origin <your-unique-team-name>
    ```

8. Deploy

    Open a browser and navigate to GitHub Actions to see the deployment progress.    

    https://github.com/56kcloud/serverless-workshop/actions


    When the deployment completes, find the URL of the API you just deployed (look for the "Deploying" step in the workflow output logs), there should be block similar to:

    ```
    Outputs:
        ProtectedApiStack.LambdaEndpoint = https://t95f7quxma.execute-api.eu-central-2.amazonaws.com/dev/
    ```

    and copy/paste the url in a new browser window. You should see the following message:

    ```
    {"message": "Welcome to the API <your-unique-team-name>!"}
    ```

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You have deployed a Python API to the cloud using infrastructure-as-code and automation.
